# Basics in C for Custom GL

This section covers the foundational C programming concepts needed to build your custom graphics library. It focuses on memory management, efficient data structures for graphics, and best practices for writing modular and maintainable code.

## Overview

While graphics libraries like OpenGL provide a high-level interface for rendering 3D graphics, implementing your own custom library from scratch requires a solid understanding of low-level programming concepts. C is a powerful language for such tasks due to its control over memory management and performance optimizations. This section is designed to help you write efficient C code that can be used to build the core components of your custom graphics library.

## Key Concepts

### Memory Management
In graphics programming, it is essential to have control over memory allocation and deallocation. This ensures that resources like buffers, textures, and data structures are managed efficiently.

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Allocate and deallocate memory for structures like vertex buffers.
- **Memory Alignment**: Ensure proper memory alignment to enhance performance, especially when dealing with large datasets (e.g., vertex arrays).

### Data Structures for Graphics
To implement a custom graphics pipeline, you'll need to understand and use various data structures. These structures are essential for storing and manipulating 3D objects, vertices, transformations, and rendering states.

- **Vertex Arrays**: A structure to hold vertex data (position, normal, texture coordinates, etc.) in memory.
- **Matrices**: Used for transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) and projections.
- **Buffers**: Arrays or linked lists for storing vertices, indices, and other information needed for rendering.

### Modular Code Design
To make your graphics library maintainable, you’ll need to structure your code into reusable and modular components. C’s support for functions, structs, and separate compilation makes it a good fit for this task.

- **Function Modularity**: Break down complex operations (like matrix multiplication, vertex transformations, etc.) into small, reusable functions.
- **Header Files**: Use header files (`.h`) to declare the interfaces for your functions and structures, keeping implementation details in source files (`.c`).
- **Separate Compilation**: Organize your code into different source files for different functionalities (e.g., separate files for memory management, transformations, etc.), and compile them separately to improve modularity and reduce code duplication.

## Conclusion

Mastering these basic C concepts will enable you to create efficient and robust code for your custom graphics library. The skills learned here are foundational and can be applied to a wide range of systems programming tasks, especially in performance-critical applications like graphics rendering.

Once you're comfortable with memory management, data structures, and modular code design, you'll be ready to move on to more advanced topics, such as implementing the rendering pipeline and shader simulations in your custom GL library.
