# Custom Graphics Library (GL) Essentials

Welcome to the **Custom GL Essentials** project! This repository is dedicated to helping developers create their own custom graphics library, inspired by OpenGL. The focus is on understanding and building the foundational components required for a custom rendering pipeline.

  - **Quaternions** (comprehensive coverage, including theory and applications)

### **[Section 2: Basics in C](CBasics/README.MD)**
- Building blocks for implementing a custom graphics library.
- Topics include:
  - Memory management
  - Data structures for graphics (e.g., vertex arrays)
  - Writing efficient and modular C code.

### **[Section 3: Rendering Pipeline](RenderingPipeline/README.MD)**
- How to design and implement a basic rendering pipeline:
  - Vertex processing
  - Primitive assembly
  - Rasterization
  - Fragment processing

### **Section 4: Shader Simulation**
- Creating your own shader-like logic:
