# Rendering Pipeline for Custom GL

This section covers the design and implementation of a basic rendering pipeline for your custom graphics library. The rendering pipeline is the sequence of steps that takes 3D data (such as vertices and textures) and processes it to produce a 2D image on the screen. Understanding and building this pipeline is crucial for creating a custom graphics library.

## Overview

The rendering pipeline consists of multiple stages, each responsible for processing different aspects of the 3D data. In a custom graphics library, you will need to implement these stages from scratch, ensuring that each one functions correctly and efficiently. The basic stages include:

1. **Vertex Processing**
2. **Primitive Assembly**
3. **Rasterization**
4. **Fragment Processing**

Each stage has specific tasks that must be implemented to transform 3D data into a final 2D image.

## Key Stages of the Rendering Pipeline

### Vertex Processing
The first stage in the pipeline, vertex processing, is responsible for transforming the vertex data (position, color, normal, etc.) from object space to camera or world space. This stage typically involves:

- **Vertex Transformation**: Applying transformation matrices (for translation, rotation, scaling) to each vertex.
- **Lighting Calculation**: Computing how light interacts with the vertices and applying the results to the vertex data.
- **Clipping**: Ensuring that vertices outside the viewing frustum are discarded.

### Primitive Assembly
Once vertices are processed, the next step is to assemble them into geometric primitives (such as points, lines, and triangles) that can be rasterized. This stage involves:

- **Connecting Vertices**: Grouping vertices into primitives based on the defined shapes (e.g., connecting three vertices to form a triangle).
- **Primitive Type Selection**: Deciding what type of primitive is being processed (point, line, triangle).

### Rasterization
Rasterization is the process of converting the geometric primitives into a 2D grid of pixels or fragments that will later be processed for color and depth. This stage includes:

- **Converting Primitives to Pixels**: Mapping the 3D coordinates of the primitives to 2D screen coordinates.
- **Interpolation**: Calculating values (e.g., color, texture coordinates) at each pixel by interpolating vertex attributes across the primitive.

### Fragment Processing
The final stage in the pipeline, fragment processing, is responsible for determining the final color of each pixel (fragment) generated during rasterization. This includes:

- **Coloring and Shading**: Applying textures, lighting models, and shaders to calculate the final color of each pixel.
- **Depth Testing**: Ensuring that fragments are properly ordered based on their distance from the camera (to handle occlusion correctly).
- **Blending**: Combining the colors of fragments with the background or other layers based on transparency or other effects.

## Conclusion

By understanding and implementing the stages of the rendering pipeline, you will have a solid foundation for creating your custom graphics library. Each stage plays a vital role in ensuring that the data is processed correctly and efficiently, ultimately allowing you to render complex 3D scenes in a 2D space.
